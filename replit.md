# Overview

yetanotherbudget is an AI-powered spending summarization and budgeting tool. The application helps users track their expenses and manage their budgets through intelligent analysis and summarization of spending patterns.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Application Structure

The repository is currently in its initial setup phase. Based on the project name and description, the system is designed to be an AI-powered financial tracking application.

### Core Features (Planned)
- **Spending Tracking**: Monitor and categorize user expenses
- **AI Summarization**: Intelligent analysis of spending patterns using AI/LLM capabilities
- **Budget Management**: Set and track budgets against actual spending

### Technology Stack

The application is built to run on Replit, suggesting:
- Cloud-native deployment model
- Potentially using Replit's built-in database solutions
- Web-based interface for user interaction

### Architectural Approach

**Problem**: Users need an accessible way to understand their spending habits and manage budgets
**Solution**: AI-powered analysis that provides insights and summaries in natural language
**Rationale**: Combining traditional budget tracking with AI makes financial data more interpretable and actionable

## Data Architecture

### Expected Data Models
- **Transactions**: Store individual spending records with categories, amounts, dates, and descriptions
- **Budgets**: Define spending limits by category or time period
- **Users**: Manage user accounts and preferences
- **AI Summaries**: Cache generated insights and analyses

### Storage Considerations
- Likely to use a relational database (potentially Postgres via Drizzle ORM)
- Transaction data requires careful indexing for efficient querying by date and category
- User data must be isolated for privacy and security

## AI Integration

### Natural Language Processing
**Problem**: Raw transaction data is difficult to interpret
**Solution**: Use LLM APIs to generate human-readable summaries and insights
**Approach**: 
- Aggregate transaction data over specified periods
- Generate contextual summaries of spending patterns
- Provide actionable budget recommendations

### Potential AI Providers
- OpenAI GPT models for text generation
- Anthropic Claude for analysis
- Other LLM APIs depending on cost and performance requirements

# External Dependencies

## Expected Third-Party Services

### AI/LLM Services
- OpenAI API or similar for spending analysis and summarization
- Requires API key management and rate limiting considerations

### Database
- Likely Postgres database for relational data storage
- May use Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries
- Could leverage Replit's integrated database offerings

### Authentication
- User authentication system (to be determined)
- Options: Replit Auth, Auth0, Clerk, or custom JWT implementation

### Potential Integrations
- Banking APIs (Plaid, Stripe, etc.) for automatic transaction import
- Export capabilities (CSV, PDF) for reports
- Calendar integrations for time-based budget periods

## Development Tools
- Replit platform for hosting and deployment
- Environment variable management for API keys and secrets
- Version control through Git/GitHub
